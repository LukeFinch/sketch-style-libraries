# Sketch Style Libraries

A lightweight plugin that lets you sync layer & text styles with a Sketch Library, so your project is always in sync.

ðŸ‘Œ Keep your whole design system in your library, and not just the symbols

ðŸ‘Œ No manual export/import via separate "style files"

ðŸ‘Œ No need to sync with another cloud service 


## Usage

1. Install plugin
2. Plugins -> ðŸ”— Sync styles with library -> Fetch from... *or* Push to...
3. Pick a library
4. Profit

## Installing

The easiest way to install Style Libraries is via Sketch Runner. Otherwise, you can clone this repo or grab the [latest release](https://github.com/sigtm/sketch-style-libraries/releases/latest)) and double click the `.sketchplugin` file to install it manually.


## What it does

Existing styles are updated (matched by name), and missing ones are added. Will be adding the ability to delete styles soon (if they don't exist in the source document).

*NOTE:* I only came across [Library Styles Sync](https://github.com/zeroheight/library-styles-sync) after publishing this, so check it out and see which one fits your workflow best. That one pulls all styles from any library you have placed a symbol from, while this one syncs both ways but only from one selected library at a time. 

So a bit more control, but adding an additional step. Beyond that, they are pretty similar.


## Acknowledgements

This plugin was made almost entirely by repurposing bits of code from existing plugins, as it was the only way I could figure out how to do anything. 

Particular credit goes to these two excellent plugins, which I wholeheartedly recommend:

[Styles Generator](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator)

[Shared Text Styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles)

[Move to library](https://github.com/ahmedmigo/Move-to-library-sketchplugin)


## Input

Hopefully this functionality will be added natively soon, but I will keep maintaining this in the meantime. If you have any thoughts, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/sigtm/sketch-style-libraries/issues)!
