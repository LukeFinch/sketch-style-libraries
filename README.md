# Sketch Style Libraries

A simple plugin that adds the option to import layer & text styles from a Sketch Library. 

This allows you to keep your whole design system in one file, and not just the symbols.


## Usage

1. Install plugin
2. Plugins -> ðŸ”— Sync styles from library...
3. Pick a library to import/update styles from
4. Profit


## What it does

If a style by the same name already exists, it updates it. If it doesn't, it adds it.


## Acknowledgements

This plugin was made almost entirely by repurposing bits of code from existing plugins, as it was the only way I could figure out how to do anything. 

Particular credit goes to these two excellent plugins, which I wholeheartedly recommend:

[Styles Generator](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator)

[Shared Text Styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles)


## Input

Hopefully this functionality will be added natively soon, but I will keep maintaining this in the meantime. If you have any thoughts, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to create an issue!
