# Sketch Style Libraries

A lightweight plugin that lets you pull layer & text styles from a Sketch Library, so your project is always in sync.

ðŸ‘Œ Keep your whole design system in your library, and not just the symbols

ðŸ‘Œ No manual export/import via separate "style files"

ðŸ‘Œ No need to sync with another cloud service 


## Usage

1. Install plugin
2. Plugins -> ðŸ”— Sync styles from library...
3. Pick a library to import/update styles from
4. Profit


## What it does

Existing styles are updated (matched by name), and missing ones are added.


## Acknowledgements

This plugin was made almost entirely by repurposing bits of code from existing plugins, as it was the only way I could figure out how to do anything. 

Particular credit goes to these two excellent plugins, which I wholeheartedly recommend:

[Styles Generator](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator)

[Shared Text Styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles)


## Input

Hopefully this functionality will be added natively soon, but I will keep maintaining this in the meantime. If you have any thoughts, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/sigtm/sketch-style-libraries/issues)!
