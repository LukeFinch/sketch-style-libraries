# Sketch Style Libraries

A lightweight plugin that lets you pull layer & text styles from a Sketch Library, so your project is always in sync.

ðŸ‘Œ Keep your whole design system in your library, and not just the symbols

ðŸ‘Œ No manual export/import via separate "style files"

ðŸ‘Œ No need to sync with another cloud service 


## Usage

1. Install plugin
2. Plugins -> ðŸ”— Sync styles from library...
3. Pick a library to import/update styles from
4. Profit

## Installing

The easiest way to install Style Libraries is via Sketch Runner. Otherwise, you can clone this repo or grab the [latest release](https://github.com/sigtm/sketch-style-libraries/releases/latest)) and double click the `.sketchplugin` file to install it manually.


## What it does

Existing styles are updated (matched by name), and missing ones are added.

*NOTE:* I only came across zeroheight's [Library Styles Sync](https://github.com/zeroheight/library-styles-sync) after publishing this, so check that one out too and see which one fits your workflow best. Library Styles Sync appears to grab all styles from any library you have placed a symbol from, while mine lets you pick one from a list. So a bit more control, but adding an additional step. Beyond that, they do the same thing :)

So if you use an iOS/Android library for device mockups but dont want its styles added to your project files, or if you want to import styles without/before placing any symbols, this plugin might come in handy. Otherwise, Library Styles Sync might be quicker for you.


## Acknowledgements

This plugin was made almost entirely by repurposing bits of code from existing plugins, as it was the only way I could figure out how to do anything. 

Particular credit goes to these two excellent plugins, which I wholeheartedly recommend:

[Styles Generator](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator)

[Shared Text Styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles)


## Input

Hopefully this functionality will be added natively soon, but I will keep maintaining this in the meantime. If you have any thoughts, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/sigtm/sketch-style-libraries/issues)!
